## Background

I am a PhD Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at **Nottingham Trent University**, where I specialize in **Cooperative Perception in Robotic Teams** for sustainable environments. My journey in robotics and AI stems from a strong foundation in electrical engineering and energy systems, which has evolved into a passion for multi-robot coordination and intelligent perception.

## Academic Journey

My academic path has taken me from electrical engineering to data science and now to robotics research:

- **PhD in Computer Science** (2023-2028, Expected) - Nottingham Trent University
- **MSc in Data Science** (Distinction, 2022-2023) - Nottingham Trent University  
- **MSc in Energy Systems (Research)** (2018-2019) - University of Moratuwa
- **BSc (Hons) in Electrical Engineering** (2013-2017) - University of Moratuwa

## Research Philosophy

My research centers on **Active Perception**—the idea that perception shouldn't be passive, but rather a dynamic decision-making process. I believe that by treating sensing as an active, optimizable task, we can enable multi-robot teams to work more efficiently in complex, real-world environments.

This philosophy drives my work in developing algorithms and frameworks that allow robots to:
- Decide *what* to sense
- Determine *when* to gather information
- Choose *where* to deploy sensing resources
- Collaborate effectively with other robots

## Why Sustainable Environments?

I'm particularly interested in applying these technologies to outdoor and natural environments, where robotics can contribute to:
- Sustainable forestry
- Precision agriculture
- Environmental monitoring
- Ecosystem conservation

These applications combine my technical interests with a commitment to developing technology that benefits both society and the environment.

## Technical Approach

I bridge the gap between theory and practice by:
- Developing high-fidelity simulations in ROS 2 and Gazebo
- Creating custom plugins for realistic environment modeling
- Testing algorithms on real hardware (Jetbot, RGB-D cameras)
- Contributing open-source tools to the robotics community

## Skills

**Core Robotics:** ROS 2, Nav2, Multi-Robot Communication, Active Perception, 3D Mapping  
**Simulation & AI:** Gazebo, Unity 3D, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning  
**Hardware:** NVIDIA Jetson / Jetbot, Intel/Realsense RGB‑D cameras  
**Programming & Tools:** Python, C++, MATLAB, Git, Linux/Bash, LaTeX

## Research Topics

- **Active Cooperative Perception:** Active sensor management for multi-robot teams — deciding *what*, *when*, and *where* to sense to maximise information gain and task performance.  
- **Network-Aware Coordination:** Coordination and planning that adapts to communication constraints and obstacle-dependent degradation; includes co-simulation approaches to validate algorithms under realistic network conditions.

## Beyond Research

When I'm not working on robotics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying connected with the broader research community through conferences and collaborations.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in discussing:
- Multi-robot systems and coordination
- Active perception and sensor management
- Outdoor robotics applications
- Collaboration opportunities

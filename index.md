## Welcome

I am a PhD Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at **Nottingham Trent University**, specialising in **Cooperative Perception in Robotic Teams** for sustainable environments. My research focuses on **Active Perception**—treating perception not as passive sensing, but as a dynamic decision-making process. This approach allows multi-robot teams to actively optimise how they gather and interpret data to solve complex tasks.

## Research Interests

- **Multi-Robot Systems**: Developing cooperative algorithms for robotic teams
- **Active Perception**: Dynamic sensor management and information gathering
- **Outdoor Robotics**: Robotics applications in natural and sustainable environments
- **ROS 2 & Gazebo**: High-fidelity simulation and real-world deployment
- **Network-Aware Coordination**: Communication-constrained multi-agent systems

## Current Position

**PhD Student** | Nottingham Trent University | Oct 2023 - Present  
*Project: Cooperative Perception in Robotic Teams for a Sustainable Environment*

Investigating active perception strategies to improve the efficiency of multi-robot teams in dynamic outdoor environments. Developing simulation frameworks in Gazebo/ROS 2 to validate cooperative algorithms before real-world deployment.

## Featured Projects

### [Jetbot VLM Navigator](https://github.com/kalhansb/jetbot_vlm_navigator)
A VLM-driven navigation system for the NVIDIA Jetbot, utilizing Vision-Language Models to interpret RGB camera data for semantic scene understanding and decision-making.

### [OHMS-NetSim](https://github.com/RAISE-NTU/ohms_netsim)
Multi-Robot Physics-Network Co-Simulator implementing high-fidelity simulation using ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo Fortress, with custom C++ plugins to emulate realistic communication degradation.

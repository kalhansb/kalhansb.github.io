## Abstract

Cooperative perception—the collaborative sensing and interpretation of environmental data by multiple robots—is increasingly vital for deploying heterogeneous unmanned ground and aerial vehicles in unstructured outdoor domains such as forests, agricultural landscapes, and peatlands. Traditional heavy machinery faces accessibility challenges, labour shortages, and ecological impacts including soil compaction. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in cooperative perception tailored to these natural outdoor applications, with a primary focus on forestry and agriculture.

First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of communication architectures, data‑fusion strategies, coordination mechanisms, and decision‑making techniques. Second, we delineate exploration and exploitation modes of operation, clarifying their roles in initial mapping and ongoing mission support. Third, we analyse the state‑of‑the‑art in communication‑aware planning, semantic and metric mapping, distributed decision processes, and multi‑robot task allocation.

Our study highlights critical research gaps—such as limited active perception behaviours, underdeveloped communication‑aware path planning, insufficient spatial‑prediction integration, and scant adoption of metric‑semantic representations. Finally, we outline a forward‑looking research agenda aimed at enabling robust, adaptive, and environmentally considerate robotic teams capable of real‑world deployment. This work serves as a foundational reference for advancing cooperative perception in multi‑robot systems for natural environments.

## Identified Research Gaps

| **Gap** | **Description** |
|---------|-----------------|
| Limited Active Perception | Few works integrate active decision-making into cooperative perception for outdoor domains |
| Communication‑Aware Path Planning | Joint optimisation of communication quality and motion planning remains underdeveloped |
| Spatial Prediction Integration | Environmental field models (e.g., Gaussian Processes) are rarely coupled with multi-robot planners |
| Metric‑Semantic Mapping | Adoption of rich metric‑semantic representations in natural environments is scarce |
| Sim‑to‑Real Transfer | Validation in real outdoor settings remains limited; most work relies on simulation |
| Heterogeneous Team Coordination | Effective coordination of ground–aerial teams in unstructured terrain needs further study |

## Research Agenda

Based on the gaps identified, we propose the following forward‑looking research directions:

1. **Active Cooperative Perception** — Develop decision‑theoretic frameworks that enable robots to actively choose what, when, and where to perceive.
2. **Communication‑Aware Planning** — Integrate realistic communication models into path and task planning for robust operation under degraded connectivity.
3. **Spatial AI for Natural Environments** — Combine spatial prediction (GPs, neural fields) with metric‑semantic scene graphs for rich environmental understanding.
4. **Scalable Heterogeneous Coordination** — Design algorithms that scale gracefully with team size and heterogeneity (UGV + UAV).
5. **Sim‑to‑Real Pipelines** — Build high‑fidelity co‑simulation frameworks (physics + network) and establish transfer benchmarks for outdoor deployments.
6. **Sustainable Robotics** — Ensure robotic solutions minimise ecological impact (e.g., soil compaction) while maximising operational efficiency.

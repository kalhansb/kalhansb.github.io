## Current Research Projects

### Cooperative Perception in Robotic Teams for Sustainable Environments
**PhD Project** | Nottingham Trent University | Oct 2023 - Present

My doctoral research investigates active perception strategies to improve the efficiency of multi-robot teams in dynamic outdoor environments. Rather than treating perception as passive sensing, I explore how robots can dynamically decide *what*, *when*, and *where* to perceive to maximize information gain and task performance.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Active sensor management in multi-robot systems
- Cooperative information gathering under communication constraints
- Outdoor robotics applications for sustainable practices
- High-fidelity simulation using ROS 2 and Gazebo
